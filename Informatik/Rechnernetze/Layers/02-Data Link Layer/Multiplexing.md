Using one physical medium to transport multiple signals is called **Multiplexing**. The goal is to achieve optimal usage of the medium.

Multiplexing can be done in multiple dimensions:
- Space
- Time
- Frequency
- Code

## Space Multiplexing
**Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA)**
Each signal gets its own medium. This might represent multiple cables or wireless transfer that is far enough apart between signals.

### Frequency Multiplexing
**Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)**
Each signal gets its own frequency. This might for example be wireless or optical frequencies.

### Time Multiplexing
**Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)**
Each signal is sent at a different point of time. How much time is assigned to each signal may vary.

- Static
	- Configuration that is static and does not change when in use.
- Dynamic
	- Set
		- Uses protocols for signaling
	- Varying
		- Access on demand without a protocol
		- [[Ethernet]], [[WLAN]]

### Code Multiplexing
**Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)**
Each signals encodes the sender of the signal. All senders send simultaneously on the same frequency band.

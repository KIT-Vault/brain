The **Code Distance** is a metric which conveys the minimum distance (amount of bits to change) so that any two different code words match. The code distance is a great indicator for error tolerance.

Plain data has a code distance of 1 -> One bit change changes the whole data
Using a [[Paritybit|parity bit]] the code distance becomes 2 -> One bit change in the data also results in the parity bit to change.
